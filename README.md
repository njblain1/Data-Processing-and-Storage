# Improvements to assignment
  To improve this assignment for future classes, I would recommend        clearer instructions, such as your expecations for how you want the     assignment to be run (what output you expect). That may include test    cases to see if we are producing the correct output you are expecting   for this assignment. Additionally, added resources would be helpful     about how this assignment material is applicable and important to the   real world and workforce.
